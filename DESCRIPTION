Description: A complete simulation engine for the Monty Hall Problem, inspired by the classic game show "Let's Make a Deal". This package includes modular functions for creating games, simulating player choices (stay or switch), managing host behavior, and calculating outcomes.Users can explore probability theory, run experiments, and analyze strategic decision-making by simulating thousands of games. Useful for teaching, demonstrations, or conducting custom variations of the Monty Hall Problem.
